Feature: Constructing objects with the webapp
  In order to add a digital object into the repository
  As an authenticated and authorised depositor
  I want to construct a Digital Object with web forms

Background:
  Given I am logged in as "user1" in the group "cm" and accept cookies

Scenario: Constructing a valid Digital Object
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  And I go to the "my collections" "show" page for "the saved pid"
  And I follow the link to upload XML
  And I attach the metadata file "valid_metadata.xml"
  And I press the button to "ingest metadata"
  Then I should see a success message for ingestion

Scenario Outline: Constructing a Digital Object with metadata that incorrect or incomplete
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  And I go to the "my collections" "show" page for "the saved pid"
  And I follow the link to upload XML
  And I attach the metadata file "<metadata_file>"
  And I press the button to "ingest metadata"
  Then I should see a failure message for <case>

  Examples:
    | metadata_file                 | case             |
    | metadata_no_rights.xml        | invalid object   |
    | invalid_schema_metadata.xml   | invalid schema   |
    | invalid_xml_metadata.xml      | invalid metadata |

Scenario Outline: Constructing a valid Digital Object
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  And I go to the "my collections" "show" page for "the saved pid"
  And I follow the link to upload XML
  And I attach the metadata file "<metadata_file>"
  And I press the button to "ingest metadata"
  Then I should see a success message for ingestion
  And the object should be of type <type>

  Examples:
    | metadata_file                 | type        |
    | dublin_core_pdfdoc_sample.xml | Text        |
    | SAMPLEA.xml                   | Sound       |

Scenario: Adding a pdf asset to an object
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  And I create an object and save the pid
  And I go to the "object" "modify" page for "the saved pid"
  And I attach the asset file "sample_pdf.pdf"
  And I press the button to "upload a file"
  Then I should see a success message for file upload

Scenario: Replacing the metadata file of a Digital Object
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  And I create an object and save the pid
  And I go to the "object" "modify" page for "the saved pid"
  When I click the link to edit
  And I attach the metadata file "valid_metadata.xml"
  And I press the button to "upload metadata"
  Then I should see a success message for updating metadata

Scenario: Constructing a Digital Object using the web form
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  When I go to the "collection" "new object" page for "the saved pid"
  When I enter valid metadata
  And I press the button to "continue"
  Then I should see a success message for ingestion
  And I should see the valid metadata

Scenario: Constructing an invalid Digital Object using the web form
  When I create a collection and save the pid
  When I go to the "collection" "new object" page for "the saved pid"
  When I enter invalid metadata
  And I press the button to "continue"
  Then I should not see a success message for ingestion

Scenario: Adding multiple audio files for a Digital Object
  When I create a collection and save the pid
