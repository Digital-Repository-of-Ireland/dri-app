<h5>Definitions</h5>

<p><strong>Access permissions</strong>  The restrictions placed on access by the Depositor.</p>

<p><strong>Authorise/ De-authorise</strong>  Authorisation is a function which specifies access rights to resources. Authorisation is related to computer security. A user with authorisation is a user with official power or permission to perform certain tasks. This may include permission to upload or modify digital objects and metadata in the system.</p>

<p><strong>Bulk Export</strong>  Any act of copying a digital object and its associated metadata from the System.</p>

<p><strong>Deposit</strong>  Any act of uploading or modifying, and publishing file or digital object and its associated metadata to the System.</p>

<p><strong>Depositor</strong>  The person or persons authorised by the Organisational Manager to upload or modify digital objects to the system.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Object</strong>  A digital object refers to any material and its associated metadata provided by the Depositor under the title applied in the metadata and deposited under the terms and conditions of the Organisational Manager Agreement and the Deposit Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Object Identifier</strong>  The International DOI Foundation has developed DOI names (Digital Object Identifier names) as actionable persistent identifiers for contentÂ­related entities. The system then provides for persistent and actionable identification and interoperable exchange of managed information on digital networks.</p>

<p><strong>Persistent identifier</strong>  Persistent identifiers are unique, maintainable links to digital objects which provide continuous access to the
object, even if it moves servers or moves to the responsibility of a different organisation.</p>
